# BFA Proposal: Protanopia
Color blindness is a common, yet mostly harmless, vision defect that can make certain tasks in everyday life more challenging than they used to.
I am born with various colorblind deficiencies and while they are not severe enough for me to require external aid, it does come up as a hinderance
from time to time. I first learned I had it when I was playing a game of *Monopoly* and could not tell the difference between the blue and purple
houses. It was basically confirmed when I went for an eye examination for my first pair of glasses; I was shown about 20 pictures and had to tell 
the number in it - I could only see about five of those 20. The only time I can recall it became a big inconvenience was when I did a project
for a graphic design class in high school. Long story short, the teacher was confused by my choice of colors. Since playing video games is my
biggest hobby, it is very much appreciated when developers implement decent colorblind systems for players.

Being color blind isn't something that can be cured, it can only be remedied or worked around with. I will make a video consisting of edited
pictures and footage of a colorblind person, like myself, how they would go through some basic challenges of everyday life.
