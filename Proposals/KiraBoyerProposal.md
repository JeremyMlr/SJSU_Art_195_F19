# Scoptophobia ![alt text](https://kiraboyer.github.io/portfolio/img/blog/eyehole_3.png "eyehole")
**Scoptophobia** is an anxiety disorder characterized by the fear of being seen or watched. I myself feel a sort of fear that I'm constantly being watched through various devices fitted with cameras that I come into view of every day. To me, it feels like the equivalent of being watched through a *keyhole*.  

When thinking about the connotations related to keyholes, my mind goes to ideas of privacy, voyeurism, intrusion, unique portals, barriers, and oculi. In this keyhole installation, I aim to address privacy in the context of our daily interactions with, or proximity to, smart devices. 
	In my installation, I will have 4 keyholes big enough for a person to look through comfortably; these will be screwed into a wall. The space between the keyholes and gallery wall will be fitted with small screens displaying individual videos. Each hole will take the viewer to a different place outside of the gallery as they seemingly peer through the lenses of cameras. Every keyhole is in a different camera perspective of 1 scene to reflect how we surround ourselves with technology and grant our devices permission to exist as extensions of ourselves within our private and public spaces. Our devices are always watching in a way, whether they are tracking our locations, being granted access to our cameras and photos, collecting and selling our personal data, etc. In this installation, the audience looking through the keyholes act as the voyeuristic cameras of our devices looking into someone's life.
