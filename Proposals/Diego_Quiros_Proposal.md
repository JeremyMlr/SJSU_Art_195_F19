# Proposal: A Transaction Journey


My proposal consists of using the game engine Godot to target the topic of microtransactions in the video game industry as a 2d platformer. Through the engine I will have the player control a character that represents a business company as they are thrown into a cave as the player is inclined to move right. Mechanics will involve projectiles,jumping, platforming, and slashing. Each new room the player enters represents a genre of a game in which you are to eliminate all enemies.The defeated enemies turn into coins signifying the effect microtransactions can have on the different game genres you encounter.


# Interaction:


The player would walk up to the cabinet and interact with the controls to move the player around.


# Equipment Required:


Power Cord and Arcade Cabinet
