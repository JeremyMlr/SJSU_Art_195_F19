## BFA Proposal: Unfiltered
Michelle Dinh

### Proposal Summary
Language has given people a way to communicate through words, sounds, acronyms, and even emojis. As younger generations become more proactive in social media, new vocabulary continue to be added into an unofficial dictionary.

For my BFA exhibition, I would like to introduce and invite others to learn about “millennial talk.” Millennial talk refers to the creation of new terminologies used by millenials (those who were born 1981-1996) and post-millenials (1997-present). As I interact with my own group of friends, I find myself picking up and learning new terms. As I look up these terms, I can find them defined on Urban Dictionary. I find that this unofficial dictionary continues to grow more as social media communities gain momentum in trends and coverage. 
 
Therefore, I want to use an Urban Dictionary API in order to access their collections of lingo in order to lessen the gap between all generations. This project would use require the use of Processing and JSON in order to pull data from Urban Dictionary’s API. The sketch will display both the word and the definition on a screen. Ideally, I would like to figure out a way to include audio pronunciations for each term. 

In order to make the work more interactive, I thought about including a writing aspect to it. Similarly, a small booth where visitors can write down their own sentences using the newly introduced term. There, other people can see how others interpret the word. The objective of this project was not intended to mock “millennial” language but to accept that it exists.
