BFA Proposal: Hidden Treasures

Proposal Summary

Hidden Treasures will be an immersive piece to give viewers thoughts and reflections on their life and how they ended up as who they are. With the ever growing big name companies and harder competition in the world, CEOs are in constant look for employees to work for them and are rewarded with a large salary. Most people follow this pathway because they want to settle and feel safe so they lose their passion and dreams and become a “yappie”. Often times we forget where we come from and what made us unique by placing us in ourselves in the rat race as we proceed with our monochromic life and ignore the colors that society shames.

How it will come to be

The piece will consist a suit of armor built by 3D modeling the piece into maya and converting the file into a program called Pepakura which will analyze the model and make printable blueprints to craft the suit. I will then create the piece printed on card stock and then spray paint it to a desired color. The suit of armor will then be in a display case and stand on in the gallery. Next I will take fluorescent or LED tubes to form a cage around the armor to prevent the viewer from getting closer to make the suit of armor look liked it is “locked”. 

Materials:
-Card Stock
