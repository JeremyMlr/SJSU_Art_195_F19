## BFA Proposal: Unfiltered
Michelle Dinh

### Proposal Summary
Language has given people a way to communicate through words, sounds, acronyms, and even emojis. As younger generations become more proactive in social media, new vocabulary continue to be added into an unofficial dictionary.

For my BFA exhibition, I would like to introduce and invite others to learn about “millennial talk.” Millennial talk refers to the creation of new terminologies used by millenials (those who were born 1981-1996) and post-millenials (1997-present). As I interact with my own group of friends, I find myself picking up and learning new terms. As I look up these terms, I can find them defined on Urban Dictionary. I find that this unofficial dictionary continues to grow more as social media communities gain momentum in trends and coverage. 
 
Therefore, I want to use an Urban Dictionary API in order to access their library of invented terms. This project would use require the use of JSON in order to pull data from Urban Dictionary’s API. I find that the word “millennial” has bad connotations associated with it, but the goal of this project is to accept that this type of language exists.

### How it Works
The website will display both the word and the definition on a screen. There will be an auto-refresh that will show a different word every 30-40 seconds. Ideally, I would like to figure out a way to include audio pronunciations for each term.

In order to make it more interactive, I wanted to create my own emojis and apply it on the website which will allow visitors to “like” or “dislike” any term. Another idea I had was to have these newly created emojis projected on both sides of the display monitor, and have a button that allows people to physically like or dislike it.
