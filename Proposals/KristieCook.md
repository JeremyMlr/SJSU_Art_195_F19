# Proposal #1: Working Together (working title)

## Summary: 
For this project, I want to highlight that working together can have a positive effect and what one does can affect the other. So an LED (LED 1) would be placed in one gallery or at one end of the gallery. A second LED (LED 2) would be placed on the opposite side or in a different gallery. LED 1 can be activated by pressing a button that will light it and LED 2 a red color. If LED 2's button is pressed first by someone then LED 2 and LED 1 will both light up blue. But if two people work together and press each button at the same time, then both will light up in a rainbow of colors. The red and blue colors deal specifically with the current affairs in the United States where the divide has grown between people because of political party colors. 

## Materials: 
- Two Led Bulbs 
- Two Buttons
- IFTTT with wifi connection
- Raspberry Pi and/or Arduino
- Housing for buttons (wood box or 3d print)

# Proposal #2: Interactive Sound Drawing

## Summary: 
A person stands in front of a screen (tv or projection) and uses a conductor like stick to  "draw" strokes in front the screen. Each stroke will leave a painted stroke that appears digitally onto the canvas (screen). Each stroke they leave makes a sound based on the type of stroke made (long, short, etc). The canvas can then be played with the use of a button nearby that will play the sounds that were made. Each person leaves a stroke and they cannot be erased. The strokes will be added on top of the previous person's work. 

## Materials:
- Screen (tv or projector)
- Users
- Conductor like stick
- Kinect
- Computer
- Speakers
