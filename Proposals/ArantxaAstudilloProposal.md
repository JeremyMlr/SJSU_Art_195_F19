<b>SUMMARY PROPOSAL:</b><br>
I am one of the many whose path has not always been clear. Since graduating high school I have changed careers a few times. I studied to be an EMT and volunteered in an emergency room as an EMT for about one week, hated it. Then I went back to school and got my Associates degree in Child Development and I worked as an art teacher for about 4 years, liked it but I needed more. Now here I am in school once again as one of the older students pursuing a career in art. Yet, I donâ€™t know what my future will look like. I feel as though my love for various things has lead me to look at so many different paths but I have been unable to walk through them. <br>

I have designed a small robot to represent what I have felt through my pursue of a loving career. A robot who invites you to imagine yourself in my shoes as I look left and right for yet another lifestyle change. A robot excited about all the possibilities of happiness but unable to decide which path to take. <br><br>

<b>MATERIALS NEEDED:</b><br>
-My robot 5X5X3.5 <br>
-One shoe <br>
-2 foot radius floor space <br>
