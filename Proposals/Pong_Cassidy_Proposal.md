# BFA Proposal: *Self-Reflection*

### Proposal Summary

Self-Reflection is an immersive exhibition intended to be a commentary on society’s behavior and how we perceive ourselves as individuals or as a group of people. With the rising popularity of social media and rapidly advancing technology, the idea of the ‘self,’ the ‘individual,’ and ‘society’ has become distorted and morphed into an array of judgmental and opinionated views on ourselves as well as others. Whether it be negative or positive, this exhibition forces us to become aware of our own bodies as well as our perception of those around us. 

### Research

Personally, I like to explore how the body interacts with an environment and what kind of dialogue it creates with the objects around it. Evolving from a digital space to the physical, I came across the idea of mirrors. Mirrors have always had a dominant factor in our lives consistently present in our bathrooms, living rooms, bedrooms, and hallways. We use them to look at ourselves, our flaws, our imperfections, or to boost our self-confidence and give praise. Many artists have used mirrors in their exhibitions such as Christian Larsen’s Mobile Mirrors, Yayoi Kusama’s infamous Infinity Mirrors Exhibition, and Jeppe Hein’s Mirror Wall and Mirror Labyrinth NY. 
  
### How it Works

About 10-20 one way/two way mirrors will be suspended at different heights (ranging from 5-6.5ft from the ground) forming a circle in the center of the exhibition space. A single light will be focused on the center of the circle, causing the inside to become reflective, while the rest of the room will be left dim. When a person stands within the circle, he/she will see him/herself reflected back while those walking around the suspended mirrors can look straight through the mirrors at the person in the center. 
  
### Questions/Next Steps

Considering the cost of the project, it may become very expensive. An alternative is to make the mirrors myself by purchasing clear acrylic sheet and mirror film separately. I will also have to consider the installation process and how to suspend the sheets from the ceiling. In addition, depending on how many mirrors I use, there will be apparent gaps between each mirror, should I cover it with fabric or leave it as is? In addition, should there be a use of sound or use silence as part of the piece?
