# BFA Show Proposal

For my BFA project, I want to create an interactive installation reflecting on the first half of 2019 for me. I had the privilege of studying abroad in South Korea in the first half of the year and it was one of the most eye opening experiences I’ve ever had. I would like to create a piece that encompasses my time there as much as possible.

**Background/Research:**

The Korean city that became my second home and all of the memories I created there are a central part to conceiving this piece. The location itself is not that known internationally (but is trying to change that by having a more “global” image) and has retained many traditional aspects of the culture over generations of modernization.

**Idea:**

When trying to come up with an idea for this project, the first thing that came to mind was articulating the modernity and traditional parts of Korea that I noticed during my stay. Therefore, I want to create a multi-colored spiral object with parts of its swirl raised at different levels. There will be various flowers in memoriam of certain events/people my time there scattered around the spiral; people can touch the spiral to make the flowers light up. In addition to lighting up flowers, participants can also play either a traditional tune of Korea or a modern one.
